# Balloon-Gun-Simulation-Project
This C++ project models a game using Discrete Mathematics. It represents objects as a Finite Set within a 2D Cartesian Product grid. Movement follows an Arithmetic Sequence ($y_n = y_{n-1} - 1$), while hit detection uses Propositional Logic ($P \land Q$). The game loop tracks Set Cardinality, ending when the active set is empty ($|B|=0$).
